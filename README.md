C port of the original P24 simulator by Dr C. H. Ting/eMast Technology cleaned up the compiler plus eForth kernel.

Have fun , this design actually made it to outer space , the STEREO mission. :)

You will need gcc and gforth to run the simulator , you will find some issues with the eForth kernel
since it's original code also had some issues , I left everything intact but will fix the kernel in future
endeavours.

As for now , enjoy it as it is :)
