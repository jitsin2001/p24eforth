C port of the original P24 simulator by Dr. C. H. Ting/eMast Technology 

So what I did is .. 

I cleaned up most of the compiler code plus eForth kernel , which now fits nicely in a single
well formatted forth source file which makes it easy to read and understand the compiler code.

Have fun , this design actually made it to outer space , the STEREO mission. :)

You will need gcc and gforth to run the simulator , you will find some issues with the eForth kernel
since it's original code also had some issues , I left everything intact but will fix the kernel in future
endeavours.

As for now , enjoy it as it is :)
